## Theory
A model of cellular Automata consists of identical cells ordered uniformly over a grid in a discrete space D-dimensional. Each cell is a dynamical variable, an its temporal change is given by a transition function, the next figure ilustrates how works this cellular automata:

The type of boundary used in this project is a von Neumann boundary, imitating the restriction of a robot which only moves in four different directions
